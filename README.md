# BITS-tutorial
Download all R files and save them to a single directory. This will be your working directory.

Start by installing R, Rstudio, and JAGS from the internet.

Use RStudio as your program to call R and JAGS

The working directory in R used forward slash. For example

setwd("C:/BITS files/") means that the files that you will use all need to be under the C drive in a folder called BITS files. You may have as many subfolders within a given folder as long as they are all indexed correctly. That is, if it is within a subfolder called tutorial inside BITS files, you will say "C:/BITS files/tutorial"

Begin by opening Model 1 - BITS-intercept.

Any text that comes after # on a line is a comment and will not be executed. This is used to help you understand the script.

Work your way through Model 1 by highlighting each line with your mouse and clicking on "Run" in the browser or ctrl+R
